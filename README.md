# LuckOrSkill
A demonstration of Veritasium's model for astronaut selection as described in their video ["Is Success Luck or Hard Work?"](https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I?t=230)

The demo assumes there are 18300 "applicants" in each cycle. I found that across 1000 cycles, the average luck of the top 11 applicants in each cycle was ~96.2%. (Veritasium found it to be around 94.7% although they do not share the specific details of their experiments.)

This shows that even if luck accounts for only 5% of someone's overall "quality", the top-quality candidates will still be those who are the “luckiest”. It's worth watching the video to understand the implications of this.
